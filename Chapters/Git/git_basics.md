## Getting Started with GitIn this chapter we introduce the basics of `git` and Version Control Systems \(VCSs\) through guided examples.We first start by setting up a repository in a remote server and then load it in our own machine.We then show how we can inspect the state of our repository and save our files into it.Once our changes are saved, we show how we can push our changes to our remote repository in a distant server.This chapter will assume you have `git` already installed in your machine, and that you're using a *nix operating system.% For users of other systems such as Windows, an appendix at the end will give some details on different setups and installation procedures.% stefMoreover, you will see that we will approach `git` with the _command-line_.Don't be afraid if you've never used it before, it is not as difficult as it may seem and you will get used to it.There is always a first time!Also, we promise you that everything you learn in here can be applied to, and will actually help you better understand, non command-line tools.![A repository as a timeline of changes.](figures/history-versions.pdf width=55&label=history_versions)### Creating a RepositoryA `git` repository is a store of files and directories.The big difference between a `git` repository and a simple filesystem is that the changes we make are stored as events, like a timeline \(Figure *@history_versions@*\).Git not only stores such a timeline but also allows us to query it, undo some of its changes, and so on.Before working with such a history/repository we need to set it up.Fortunately, setting up a `git` repository is much lightweight than setting up a database repository.Though there are many different ways to create a `git` repository, we will start with a simple solution to be up and running as fast as possible.We will study other ways to setup repositories in Chapter *@expert_git@*.Let's proceed to create a repository in an online hosting service such as GitHub or GitLab.On GitHub use the _New Repository_ action. Figure *@new_repo_github@* shows the kind of form GitHub provides to its users to create a new repository.![Creating a new repository on Github.](figures/new-repository-github.png width=65&label=new_repo_github)Following the form/wizard will eventually get you a running repository on-line.You will be most probably then redirected to your repository page.Figure *@repository_page@* shows how such a page looks like in GitHub.![Repository page for a project called **test** in GitHub.](figures/GitHub_repository_page.png width=65&label=repository_page)We are almost set to work from the command line now.However, we need to set-up our mind around a couple of extra concepts.The repository we just created does not exist in our machine.Actually, it is stored in some server maintained by GitHub/GitLab.To interact with this repository we will need a network connection.We will call this repository, living in a remote server, a **remote repository**.### git clone@cloningGit, constrastingly to other VCSs, is a distributed VCS.This has a lot of consequences in the way we work, that we will study in detail in Chapter *@expert_git@*.For now, you will have to remember only one thing: instead of being connected all the time to our remote repository, we will work on the repository on your machine \(called a local repository\).Eventually, we will synchronize the state between our **local** repository with the **remote** one \(Figure *@commit_in_workflow-basic@*\).This is what makes possible the disconnected or off-line workflow that people often praise in `git`.![Basic git architecture: You change the files in your working copy, commit changes to local repository and synchronize your local repository with remote ones.](figures/commit_in_workflow2.pdf width=90&label=commit_in_workflow-basic)Making a local copy of a remote repository is such a common task that `git` has a dedicated command for it, the `git clone [url]` command.The `git clone` command receives as argument the URL of our repository, that we can get from our repository page.You will see that your repository page will offer you different URL options, the most used being SSH and HTTPS urls.We will use in this chapter HTTPS URLs because they have an easier setup, but for those readers that are curious, Section *@sshvshttps@* compares SSH and HTTPS, and Section *@setupssh@* shows how to setup your SSH environment.To obtain the HTTPS URL of your repository, go to your repository's page and look for it under the clone/HTTPS options.As an example, Figure *@HTTPS_GitHub@* illustrates how to get such url from a GitHub project page.![Getting the HTTPS url of your repository from GitHub.](figures/HTTPS_url_GitHub.png width=90&label=HTTPS_GitHub)Copy that url and use type your command as in:```language=bash$ git  clone [url]
Cloning into '[your_project_name]'...
remote: Counting objects: 11082, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 11082 (delta 2), reused 6 (delta 2), pack-reused 11076
Receiving objects: 100% (11082/11082), 4.35 MiB | 1.22 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (4063/4063), done.
Checking connectivity... done.```When the command finishes, `git` is done creating a directory named as your repository \(your\_project\_name\).We will call this directory the **working directory** as it is where we will work and interact with our repository.The working directory, with all the files and directories it contains, is managed by `git` and linked to our repository.Do not worry, there is nothing else you need to do to keep this link, `git` will automatically track your changes for you.You are now ready to go and start working on your project.### Making changes: How does `git` track my changes?Let's now dive in our working directory and start making changes to it.We'll for example create a file called `project.txt`, then open it with a text editor and add some lines to it.```language=bash$ cd your_project_name
$ touch project.txt
...```After some time working, we can use the `ls` command to check the files in my directory.```language=bash$ ls
project.txt README.md```And then the `cat` command to check their contents from the command line.```$ cat project.txt
# Done
 - created the repository
 - ==git== clone
 - created this file
 
# To do
 - commit this file
 - push it to my remote repository``````language=bash$ cat README.md
#My Project

This project is an example ==git== repository used to learn ==git==.
Check the project.txt file for information about pending tasks.```Basically, we have modified some files, but we have done no `git` at all.What does `git` know about these files at this point?#### `git` does Nothing without your PermissionA new important thing to grasp about `git` at this point is that it will do nothing until we explicitly ask it to do it.In this sense, `git` is not any kind of repository but a transactional repository.All changes we do in our working directory are not stored by `git` automatically.Instead, we need to explicitly store them using a `commit` command, as we do with transactional database to store any data.The transactional aspect means also that:- while we do not commit, we can easily rollback our changes;- the other side of the coin, until we commit all our changes are in a transient state, and we may lose them.We will see more of this _explicitness_ applied in other cases in the course of this book.Sometimes it may seem that `git` is just dumb, and that it cannot guess what we want to do when it is obvious.However, the case is that `git` has so many possibilities that not guessing is the healthier decision in most cases.Especially when considering destructive operations that may make you lose hours of work.#### `git status`We can then turn our question around: Does `git` know something about these files?Git indeed tracks our files to know what should be saved and what should not.We can use this information to see what are actually the changes that happened while we were working.The `git status` command produces a list of the current changes.```language=bash$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	project.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")```Reading the output of `git status` we can see that it lists several information:- **Changes not staged for commit.** Lists the modified files that `git` already knows.- **Untracked Files.** Lists the files that are in the working directory but were never added under the control of `git`.Also, `git status` shows some hints about possible commands that we may use next such as `git add` or `git checkout`.#### `git` and directoriesYou may have observed a curious behaviour with directories.If you create an empty directory and then use the `git status` command, you'll notice the directory is not listed at all.It even looks like the directory is being completely ignored.For example, if we try adding an empty directory into a new repository `git` will actually say _working tree clean_ as if there were no changes at all.```language=bash$ mkdir emptyDirectory
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean```Indeed, `git` does not manage empty directories but only files.Directories are only modelled as paths to get to files.No extra information is tracked for them.In other words, we cannot just store directories into `git`.And in case we want to do it for some reason, we need to put files into them.### Commiting your changesWe would like now to save our changes in our `git` repository.This way, if anything happens, we can always recover our work up to this point.We have said before that the operation of saving our work in the repository is called a **commit**.If we try the `git commit` command we will see this is not as direct as expected.```language=bash$git commit
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
	README.md
	project.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present```If we read Git's message, we will notice that though it has correctly identified that we have new files, `git` is asking us to _add_ them before it can commit them.#### The Groceries MetaphoreTo make it simple, you can see this whole tracking story as going to the supermarket.Imagine you make your grocery list and go to the supermarket.To get our groceries and take them home, we need first to go look for them, put them in our shopping cart, and then go and pay for them.An extra service may propose to take your grocery list and do the groceries for you.But such an extra service requires that you make a list up-front. Same apply with `git`, the default behavior of `git` is not  to commit all the changes.Partly because Git's philosophy is to ask the user explicitly what to do, which in this case is translated to asking what to commit.Instead, `git` requires us to add the files we want to commit to a list of _added_ files, also called in `git` terminology the _staging area_, and equivalent to your shopping list.Once our staging area is full with the changes we want to commit, we can commit such changes using the `git commit` command.#### A first commitAdding changes to your staging area is done through the `git add [file]` command.Let's proceed to add our changes and see what is the status of our repository afterwards.```language=bash$ git  add README.md
$ git  add project.txt
$ git  status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   README.md
	new file:   project.txt```Now `git` says that our two new files are listed as "to be committed".Let's now proceed to save our changes in the repository with the `git commit -m "[message]"` command.The _message_ used as argument of this command is a piece of text that we can use to explain the contents of the changes, or the intention of our changes.```language=bash$ git  commit -m "first version"
[master a93c016] first version
 2 files changed, 12 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 project.txt```If we check the status of our repository after the commit is done, we see that it has changed.There is nothing to commit:```language=bash$ git  status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean```#### Add then commit, all over againIf we repeat the process and we change one of our existing files, we will see something interesting.Commiting our changes in a file we added before requires that we do a `git add [file]` and `git commit` again on the same file, even if `git` already knew about it.```$ cat project.txt
# Done
 - created the repository
 - ==git== clone
 - created this file
 - commit this file
 
# To do
 - push it to my remote repository``````language=bash$ git  status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   project.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")```This is because even if on the surface `git` seems to manage files, it actually manages _changes_ to those files.Technically speaking, the changes we have done are _new_ changes, so we have to tell `git` we are interested in those changes.```language=bash$ git  add project.txt
$ git  commit -m "Commit is not in ToDo anymore"
[master e14a09f] Commit is not in ToDo anymore
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)```### Synchronizing with your Remote RepositorySo far we have worked only on the local repository residing in our machine.This means that mostly all of `git` features are available without requiring any internet connection, making it suitable for working off-line \(think on working on the train or with a constrained connection!\).However, working off-line is a two-edged sword: all your changes are also captive in your machine.While your changes are in your machine, nobody else can contribute or collaborate to them.Moreover, losing your machine would mean losing all your changes too.Keeping your changes safe means to synchronize them from time to time with your remote repository. `git`'s metaphore for remote synchronization is based on the ideas of _pulling_ and _pushing_ changes between repositories. `git` takes the perspective that we are located in our local repository.We bring other's changes by _pulling_ them from remote repositories to our local repository.We send our changes by _pushing_ them from our local repositories to one or many remote repositories.#### Getting Remote Changes with `git pull`@pulling_basicBefore being able to share our commits in some external server, we need before to update our repository to avoid them being de-synchronized.While you can always try to share your commits by directly pushing \(see Section *@pushing@*\), you will see with experience that `git` favors pulling before pushing.This is, among others, because in your local repository you have complete control to do whatever manipulation you want, what is especially important to solve mistakes and merge conflicts.You cannot do the same in your remote repository.In our example pulling does not seem really necessary because you are the only person modifying your repository.No new changes happened in the remote repository in the meantime.However, let's imagine that you have done a modification in this same repository from another machine or even a different clone in the same machine \(which are totally feasible scenarii\).In that case, you would like to update your local repository with those new changes.Updating our repository is done through the `git pull` command.Pulling will update our database and then update our files.```language=bash$ git  pull

Three different scenarii can actually happen from a pull operation, which will be:- **Fast-forward**: the updates were applied without needing a merge.- **Automatic Merge**: the updates were applied without conflicts. `git` had to do a merge commit and will ask you for a commit message.- **Merge Conflict**: The changes you did and incoming changes affect some common files. In this case `git` does not know what version to keep \(or even if a mixture is possible\) and asks you to solve it manually before doing a new commit.Once the merge is resolved, your working copy is updated with the new version of your repository.Luckily for us, fast-forward and automatic merges are the simplest and more common ones.They require almost no manual interaction other than introducing a message.#### Sending your Changes with `git push`@pushingThe final step in our `git` journey is to share our changes to the world.Such sharing is done by **push**ing commits to a remote repository, as shown in Figure *@push_in_workflow@*.To push, you need to use the `git` command `git push [remote] [remote_branch]`.This command will send the commits pointed from your your current branch to the remote \[remote\] in the branch \[remote\_branch\].```language=bash$ git  push origin master

  development   1656797 This commit adds a new feature
  master        f269295 [origin/master] First commit```When a branch has no upstream, a push operation will by default fail with a `git` error.Git will ask us to set an upstream, or otherwise specify explicitly a pair remote/branch for each push.```language=bash$ git  push
fatal: The current branch test has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    ==git== push --set-upstream origin test

$ git  push --set-upstream origin test

   b6dcc3f..f269295  master -> test```#### Pushes can get RejectedIn some scenarii `git` may reject our pushes, so they are not saved to the remote repository.In general `git` rejects changes when the remote repository has diverged from ours.Of course a rejection may also happen when we don't have write permissions in the remote repository.The typical error shows something like the following:```language=bash$ git  push
To git@github.com:guillep/test.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:[your_username]/[your_repo_name].git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.```As the error message says, the remote has changes that we do not have locally.In other words, our push has been rejected because otherwise we would have overwritten the remote changes.Instead, we need to take the remote changes and _mix and match_ them with our changes, by applying a pull \(Section *@pulling@*\) and a merge \(*@merging@*\).After the pull, our repository will have our outgoing changes, but no more incoming changes, and so our push will not be rejected### OverviewIn this chapter we have studied the basic operations of `git`.We have seen that a new repository starts in your local machine with a `git clone` that creates a working copy directory.Changes in our working copy are tracked by `git` automatically and we can query the tracking using `git status`.We can then proceed to operate on our changes as illustrated in *@simple_overview@*.![Overview of `git` basic operations: `add`, `commit`, `pull` and `push` \(+ extra `fetch` and `merge`\).](figures/simple_overview.pdf width=90&label=simple_overview)We have seen that:- `git add` tells `git` about files to track for commit.- `git commit` finishes a transaction and stores our changes in a commit.- `git pull` synchronizes a remote repository with our local repository by doing first a `fetch` and then a `merge`. Different merge scenarios may happen, in which some of them cause conflicts that have to be manually resolved.- `git push` sends our changes to a remote repository. A push can get rejected.### Exercises1. **Exercise 1**. Create an account in your preferred `git` repository hosting service, create there a repository and clone it. Then, check its history from the command line. How many commits are there in the repository? Tip: there is a difference if you checked the "create README.md file" checkbox while creating a repository.1. **Exercise 2**. Create a file, a file inside a directory and an empty directory. Commit them \(remember, `git add`, `git commit`\). What can you see there? How does `git` manage directories?1. **Exercise 3**. If you're on a unix system \(linux/osx\), try changing your file's permissions and check `git status`. How does `git` treat file permissions? Commit your changes and check the log. What can you observe?1. **Exercise 4**. Push now your changes to your remote repository. Then, clone your repository again in another directory. Tip: try checking the help of the clone command `git clone -h`. Did `git` save all your files, directories and even permissions?1. **Exercise 5**. Go back to your first repository, add a new file, commit it and push it. Then go back to the second repository and pull. Inspect the history in both repositories: Is it the same?1. **Exercise 6**. Check your online repository on your hosting service. Can you see the same state as in your local repositories? Go over the different tools offered by the hosting, they usually give some idea of the activity of the project, try to understand what they are for.
